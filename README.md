# Renault misc repo

You can see here my personal repo which contains scripts, Linux kernel modules,
commands reminder and other little software.

I created this repo to share code with anyone and to sync that between my different computers.

All of them are under GPLv3, except kernel modules which are under GPLv2.

Tree explanations:

* contrib: some patches about other Free Software project
* commands: list of useful commands for Linux system or software development
* configs: software configurations
* exercises: exercises in C or other language, based on K&R ou Eudyptula challenge for example
* modules: Linux kernel patches or modules
* projects: little personal or academic projects
* scripts: miscellaneous working tools
* tests: software to compute or test a feature
* texts: some texts about Fedora or embedded system, mainly in French

Other stuff should be added with the time !
